## Mexico City Crime by Neighborhood
- In this visualization I present an analysis for Mexico City crime rates by neighborhood, trying to understand how this is the pattern to be in future.
- In all districtâ€™s theft is the most common crime, meaning that the likelihood of this crime to be committed is greater than every other crime.
- It was a surprise to see the quartile of Districts with lower crime rate. Keep in mind that data shows only criminal complaint filings.
- The crime tendency is increasing if we compare the results with previous years
- It is important to have a culture of filing criminal complaint so that in the future the accuracy of the data can increase. The information show only the reports in institutions.
